    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>The best lava cake I've ever had! Serve these decadent molten chocolate cakes topped with powdered sugar or vanilla ice cream. This recipe makes four delicious individual desserts.</p>

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 ounce</strong> semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li><strong>Half cup</strong> butter, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li><strong>Third cup</strong> white sugar</li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> all purpose flour</li>
        <li><strong>4 tablespoons</strong> unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li><strong>1 pinch</strong> salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour four 6-ounce ramekins.</li>
        <li>Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Mix in melted chocolate, flour, and cocoa powder until combined. Pour batter into the prepared ramekins and place on a baking tray.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is still jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
