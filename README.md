Odin HTML Recipes Project

The project was to make a website with several webpages linked to a different recipe

It demonstrates the skills:
- Forming a html boilerplate
- Linking webpages together
- Using headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists
- Using absolute image links
- Git commit messages
- Familiarity with the basics of HTML 

Issues:
- Website kept wanting to be in French/translated to English despite the language attribute being defined
    - Solved by fixing a typo in the heading

- Linking index to spagbol wasn't working
    - Solved when a typo was corrected in the href element

- Other issues were to do with formatting

Other notes:
- Reviewed other's websites and included a feature I saw other's use
    - A return to main page link at the bottom of each individual recipe
